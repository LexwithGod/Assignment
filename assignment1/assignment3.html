    <p> "Live House" is the abbreviation of "Live Music House", in a broader sense, it no longer refers to a single venue, and the content and style of the performance are not limited, but the most applied concept is to become a new mode of music performance in Live House, integrating creation and marketing in the same time and space.</p>
    <p> In recent years, young music consumers aged 18-35 have been increasingly interested in the live performance at Live House, which had an audience of 560,000 in 2012; by 2016, the scale of attendance had exceeded 900,000. Some figures show that the music performance market grew rapidly in 2016, reaching an overall size of 16 billion yuan. This represents a year-on-year increase of 6.7%. The total box office revenue was about 4.813 billion yuan, of which box office revenue from theatre music performances was about 1.227 billion yuan; box office revenue from concerts was about 3.021 billion yuan; box office revenue from music festivals was about 483 million yuan; and total box office revenue from Live House was 82.85 million yuan and grew at an annual rate of 20%. According to estimates by industry bodies, the total box office figures of Live House nationwide in 2017 are expected to exceed RMB120 million.</p>
        
    <p>Although the live house industry has suffered greatly in the past few years due to Covid-19, we still believe it has great potential for future thrive. But I do see some problems that currently consumers are facing：</p>
    <ol class="problem"> 
        <li> Information is scattered across multiple platforms, and there is a lack of an integrated website to support users to complete the task of getting the live show information, venue information, ticket purchase and feedback evaluation, I am trying to build a community for music fans to share information and feedback on live house.
        e.g., get show information on the official public website/ from the performers, buy tickets on 秀動, find out how to travel on RED, and rate on 大眾點評 </li>
        
    <li> Most of the current summaries of live house information in China are compiled by private individuals, and the information is not updated in a timely manner; most of the official information, such as "大眾點評", will bring up upcoming events when searching for "shows/events", but there are few reviews of live house venues.</li>
        
    <li>The choice of which live house to go is a complete buyer's market, with fans choosing to go wherever the band is playing. Thus, I am wondering whether it is possible to use a comprehensive evaluation and feedback system to in turn force live houses to provide upgrades in terms of audio quality and service.</li>
