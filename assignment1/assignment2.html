    <h2>1. Restaurant category</h2>
    <h3>Primary category </h3>
    <p>After data cleaning, I narrow down the primary category into 8 types. Among them, Western cuisine accounts for the highest proportion, followed by Hong Kong/Cantonese and Japanese cuisine, 
        all with more than 300 restaurants, accounting for 29.9%, 21,3%, and 19.7% respectively, as shown in the pie chart below:</p>

    <p> However, only 3 types of them got an average rating greater than or equal to 4.0, namely Japanese, multinational, and Central and South American cuisine. 
        The highest rating of dislikes was for other Asian and other Chinese cuisines, 
        and the lowest was for Middle Eastern/Mediterranean cuisine, but it didn’t get a high rating. Interestingly, 
        the quantity of Central and South American cuisine is the lowest, but 7 of them got the most collections. </p>

    <h3> Secondary category </h3>
    <p>These restaurants also have some secondary categories as tags on Open Rice, 
        which I have clustered and then made a word cloud to show more visually what types of dining are concentrated in Tsim Sha Tsui. </p>

    <h2>2. Restaurant address</h2>
    <p> The top 10 roads with the highest number of restaurants are as shown below, 
        among them 廣東道 has the most restaurants but those in 漆咸道 got the highest rating.</p>

        </div>
        
    <div class="right"> 
            <div class="text">
            <p> Choosing the top three categories （日本菜, 港式/粵菜, 西式）and their address, we can find that there are 3 roads having over twenty Japanese cuisines, 
                4 having over twenty Hong Kong / Cantonese Cuisines and 6 having over twenty Western cuisines. 
                Also, surprisingly, I found that there’s only 1 restaurant on 松山道, but it has the most collection. </p>
            <h2> 3. Restaurant price range </h2>
            <p> Each price range is represented as follows, $101-200 takes up the most, with a percentage of 25.1%, followed by $201-400 (23.7%), %51-100 (20.3%). Although TST is the area with the highest consumption in Hong Kong, restaurants with per capita prices above 800 are still the fewest, accounting for only 3.5%.
                 It is worth noting that the price range of a restaurant is directly proportional to its rating, the higher the price, the higher the rating.</p>
            <img src="price_range.png" width="400" height="250">
            <p>Different categories have different price ranges. For example, the prices of Central and South American cuisines range from 100-800, 
                neither below 100 nor above 800. And there are 6 categories that cover all the price ranges. </p>
            <img src="price_ratio.png" width="350" height='300'>
            <p> For the location, 廣東道 and 彌敦道 have the most restaurants with a price over $200. 
                We can assume that there are higher levels of consumption in those blocks. </p>
            <img src="rds_price.png" width="300" height="200">
            <p> The above is the basic situation of the distribution of restaurants in Tsim Sha Tsui, hope it will be helpful for you when deciding which street to go to and which restaurant to eat at. 
                In conclusion, if you are a tourist who has a budget of $101-200 but wants to find a restaurant with a good reputation (rating >4.0) in the busiest districts of TST (which we think should have 50 or more restaurants), 
                <b>“PUTIEN”</b> in Mira Place may be a good choice for you.</p>
